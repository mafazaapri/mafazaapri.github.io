                The first part of Big game golf project is to create a new
                identity. The current logo they have is outdated and needs to be
                revamped.

                The first part of Big Game Golf project I was assigned to
                rebranding their existing identity. The new logo will be used on
                their new mobile app platform, website and eventually used as
                their new visual identity.

                  I work closely with my team to do brainstorming starting from currating
                  moodboard of how we envision the new logo concept and present
                  it to the internal team. The purpose was to see each other's
                  perspective and collectively put down ideas that we feel align
                  with the brand  for the final delivery.

                  Additionally we analyze the current logo and one takeaway we
                  grasp from the discovery phase is that, the client wants to
                  avoid using the golf ball on the logo since potentially this
                  game will expand in the future not only limited to golf but it
                  could be another game such as soccer, basketball, and any
                  other sports game related.

                The next step was to start sketching and putting my ideas together. 
                I aimed to create a new concept that represents the sports industry without being overly iconic, 
                looking playful yet simple. I wanted to design something that is both straightforward and memorable for users. 
                I decided to use elements that represent sports, such as circles and flag shapes. 
                Below is my first draft with different concepts, which I presented to my internal team.

                  After curated few concept me and my team ready to present our
                  first draft to stakeholders. While we do receive positive
                  feedback unfortunately the stakeholder are not certain on
                  the concept we presented. We took note on important things and
                  aspect to consider and decided to come back with second draft
                  of concept.

                  Based on the feedback from the first draft, I started working on the first iteration. 
                  I gained a better understanding of the direction and theme they wanted to pursue. 
                  I focused on creating concepts with symbols of speed or motion to represent sports 
                  in general while maintaining a modern look. Below are some trials that I illustrated, 
                  presenting the concept in different shades of green.

                The final design was developed through multiple iterations and based on feedback both internally and externally. 
                The concept features a flying ball at high speed, symbolizing the sports industry. 
                The effect of speed represents the power and strength of a major golf game.

                The first part of Big game golf project is to create a new
                identity. The current logo they have is outdated and needs to be
                revamped.

                The first part of Big Game Golf project I was assigned to
                rebranding their existing identity. The new logo will be used on
                their new mobile app platform, website and eventually used as
                their new visual identity.

                  I work closely with my team to do brainstorming starting from currating
                  moodboard of how we envision the new logo concept and present
                  it to the internal team. The purpose was to see each other's
                  perspective and collectively put down ideas that we feel align
                  with the brand  for the final delivery.

                <p className="max-w-[40.625rem]">
                  Additionally we analyze the current logo and one takeaway we
                  grasp from the discovery phase is that, the client wants to
                  avoid using the golf ball on the logo since potentially this
                  game will expand in the future not only limited to golf but it
                  could be another game such as soccer, basketball, and any
                  other sports game related.

                The next step is I start to sketch and put my ideas together, I
                ideate the new concept has to represent sports industry without
                being iconic, look playful, and simple. I wanted to design
                something simple yet memorable for users to notice. My decision
                was to use elements that represent sports such as circle and
                flag shape. Below was my first draft with different concepts
                and i presented it to my internal team which later on we decided
                to focus on simplier version.

                  speed or motion symbol which represent sports in general and
                  keep the modern look in it. Below are some trial that I
